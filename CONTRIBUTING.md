The whole point of this repo is for one to understand DSA and coding by making terminal C++ games.
This makes it both fun and informative for you.
As a contributor, make sure that you broaden the scope of this repo by introducing new concepts or ideas rather than "paraphrasing" an already existing game.

If you are a first time contributor, it is always good to submit your first PR [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

and once you've gotten a hang of it, you can contribute in one of two ways:

1. Raise the game you want to develop as an issue, once it is accepted and assigned to you, you can submit your PR.
2. Take a look at any open issues and ask to be assigned to the one you want and submit your PR.
