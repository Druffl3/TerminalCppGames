# TerminalCppGames
A one stop place for a collection of terminal games made with C++

The best way to learn anything, especially in tech and coding, is to jump straight into building something. But, the 'coding-block' never goes away and we are forever lost in a 'idea-seaking' limbo.

To snap out of it, just pick up a 2D pixel game that you like, and try to re-create a terminal version of it with C++. Or if you have an original idea and want to share the goodness with the rest of us, go ahead and submit that PR.
