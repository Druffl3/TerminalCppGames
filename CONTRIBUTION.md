The whole point of this repo is for one to understand DSA and coding by making terminal C++ games.
This makes it both fun and informative for you.
As a contributor, make sure that you broaden the scope of this repo by introducing new concepts or ideas rather than "paraphrasing" an already existing game.

If you are a first time contributor, it is always good to practice it here: https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions

Once you get a hang of it just:

1. Fork
2. Edit/Create
3. Commit
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Game
